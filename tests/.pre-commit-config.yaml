### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit to enforce consistent code style and security checks before commits.

Setup:
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install

Usage:
- Pre-commit hooks run automatically when you commit.
- If checks fail (black formatting, flake8 linting, or bandit security scan), the commit will be blocked until issues are fixed.
- To run checks manually:
pre-commit run --all-files
